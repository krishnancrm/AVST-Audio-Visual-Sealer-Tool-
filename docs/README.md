# Digital Fort: YYx Forensic Lattice
**Project Goal:** Secure image authentication resilient even with 90% data loss (on a lossy compression).

### How it Works
1. **Intake**: The script dynamically scans the `/Screenshots` folder.
2. **20x Elongation**: Each of the signature is amorphous by converting high structural energy to low structural energy.
3. **4x4 Redundancy**: The signature is mirrored across 16 sectors. Authentication succeeds if even ONE sector survives (Survivor Logic).
4. **Silicon Anchor**: Uses GPS, MAC ID, and Timestamp to lock the forensic seal.
5. Possess self killer license for one month.

### Instructions
1. Place images in the `Screenshots/` folder.
2. Run `python main_batch_test.py`.
3. Review `final_forensic_report_batch.csv`.
